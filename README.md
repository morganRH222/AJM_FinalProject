### 🐾 ABOUT THIS DASHBOARD 🐾

This interactive flexdashboard uses American Kennel Club (AKC) data to explore dog breeds from three main angles:

- **Popularity over time (2013–2020)** using yearly AKC ranks (1 = most popular).  
- **Behavior, care, and suitability traits** scored from 1 (low) to 5 (high).
- **Trait definitions** to help interpret the 1–5 scores (1 = low, 5 = high).
- **Relationships between traits**, such as which characteristics tend to go together.

Across the tabs, you can:

- **📝 Overview**  
  - See an example table of AKC popularity ranks for many breeds from 2013–2020.  
  - Get a quick sense of how “rank” works (lower rank = more popular) before diving into details.

- **📊 Summary**  
  - View key summary metrics in value boxes, including:
    - Total number of breeds in the dataset  
    - Most and least popular breeds in 2020  
    - The breed with the biggest improvement and the biggest drop in rank (2013–2020)  
  - Explore:
    - Average trait scores across all breeds  
    - How each trait’s scores are distributed (e.g., which traits most breeds score high or low on)

- **🏆 Popularity**  
  - Select one or more breeds and compare their AKC popularity rank trends from 2013–2020 in an interactive line plot (hover for tooltips).  
  - See images of the selected breeds in a small gallery.  
  - Hover over points in the popularity plot to display a larger breed image and name in a dedicated panel.

- **🔍 Breed Traits Explorer**  
  - Choose a single breed and view:
    - A sketch and a full-color photo for that breed  
    - A bar chart showing the breed’s trait profile (how it scores on each behavioral and care trait, 1–5)  
  - Browse an interactive table describing what each trait means and how to interpret a score of 1 vs. 5.

- **🔗 Trait Correlation**  
  - Examine a heatmap of correlations between traits (from –1 to +1) to see which characteristics tend to vary together.  
  - View a ranked table of the strongest positive and negative trait correlations.  
  - Select any two traits and:
    - See a scatterplot of breeds, with a fitted regression line and correlation value.  
    - Hover over points to identify the breed and view its image in a companion panel.

Overall, this dashboard is designed to help you:
- Compare how popular different breeds have been over time.  
- Understand each breed’s behavioral and care traits in detail.  
- Discover patterns and relationships among traits across all breeds, with images and interactivity to make the data more intuitive and fun to explore.
